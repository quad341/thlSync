The Hit List Sync

This project is made to help people who like to use The Hit List (THL) to manage
tasks, but they aren't always connected to their mac that normally runs it. To
solve this, the system will have three components:
 - Web storage: a simple, single user storage system that can accept deltas in
   todos and store them along with time information. It can also report what
   changes or change sets it has as well as the latest time information it
   stores. It can then return requested deltas in the same format
 - THL connector: A relatively simple script for actually handeling querying THL
   itself as well as inserting data when told to. this will have to handle any
   idiosyncracies that may arise such as changes in modification time
 - daemon: This connects the two components. It will use the connector as
   configured to check on its latest modified date/time and compare with the
   server. it will then move deltas from the newer one to the older one

Status:
 - Demo daemon created to work with FSEvent to watch the THL folder for changes
