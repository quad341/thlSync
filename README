The Hit List Sync

This project is made to help people who like to use The Hit List (THL) to manage
tasks, but they aren't always connected to their mac that normally runs it. It
seeks to solve this problem by creating a daemon that will deal with syncing
local files to a server. The server component will handle storing the data as
well as provide a web interface for todos (probably with reduced functionality)

Status:
 - Demo daemon created to work with FSEvent to watch the THL folder for changes
